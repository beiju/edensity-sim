# Blaseball eDensity simulator ![BETA](https://img.shields.io/badge/BETA-lightgrey?style=flat)

This is a blaseball eDensity visualizer & simulator, roughly based on this [seminal paper](https://research.blaseball-reference.com/SIBR_eDensity2.pdf) on the subject.
The simulator uses publicly accesible APIs to fetch the eDensity information for a team. All the data collection is currently done client-side, so loading can take a while.

The eDensity information may not be 100% accurate yet, so use at your own risk.

## Usage
