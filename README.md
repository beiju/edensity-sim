Blaseball eDensity simulator!

This uses publicly accesible APIs to fetch the eDensity information for a team. All the data collection is currently done client-side, so it may take a while to load.

The eDensity information is not 100% accurate yet; several factors are missing, such as player eDensity contributions besides soul. Also, the site is not yet feature-complete.

That said, you can visit the site here: [https://hexane360.github.io/edensity-sim/](https://hexane360.github.io/edensity-sim/)

Thanks to the SIBR and [blaseball-reference.com](https://blaseball-reference.com/) for their wonderful CORS proxy and database. Thanks to the commisioner for blaseball.
